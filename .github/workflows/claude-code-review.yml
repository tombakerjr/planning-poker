            **Context:**
            - Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions and architecture
            - Check .serena/memories/ for additional codebase context
            - Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand current phase and goals

            **Review areas:**
            - Security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, auth bypass, secrets)
            - Critical bugs (data loss, crashes, logic errors)
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Performance issues
            - Test coverage gaps
            - Breaking changes
            - Adherence to CLAUDE.md conventions

            **Communication style:**
            - Prefer brevity: bullet points, direct feedback
            - Verbose explanations are acceptable when necessary for clarity or complex issues
            - Group related issues together
            - Prioritize: Critical > Important > Nice-to-have
            - Skip trivial style issues unless pattern violations
            - If clean: "✅ No significant issues found"

            Review this PR for actionable issues only. Read CLAUDE.md and .serena/memories/ for context.

            **What to report:**
            - 🔴 CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, data loss bugs, crashes
            - 🟡 FIX: Bugs, logic errors, missing error handling
            - 🟠 TEST: Missing tests for new/changed code paths
            - 💡 CONSIDER: Non-trivial improvements worth discussing

            **What NOT to report:**
            - Don't summarize what the PR does (assume I read the description)
            - Don't list what's good or praise the code
            - Skip style nitpicks, minor refactors, "nice to haves"
            - Skip issues already mentioned in the PR description as known limitations

            **Special case:**
            - If PR description is misleading or doesn't match the code, add: 📝 UPDATE PR: [what's wrong]

            **Format:**
            ```
            🔴 CRITICAL: file.ts:123 - SQL injection in user input
            🟡 FIX: api.ts:45 - Missing null check causes crash
            🟠 TEST: No tests for the new retry logic
            💡 CONSIDER: Cache could cause stale data for 60s
            ```

            If no actionable issues: `✅ LGTM - no blocking issues`

            Post via `gh pr comment`. Prefix with "**[Concise Review]**"
