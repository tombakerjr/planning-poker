            Review this PR as a senior engineer would. Be thorough but concise.

            **Context:**
            - Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions and architecture
            - Check .serena/memories/ for additional codebase context (even without Serena MCP server)
            - Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand current phase and goals

            **Review areas:**
            - Security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, auth bypass, secrets)
            - Critical bugs (data loss, crashes, logic errors)
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Performance issues
            - Test coverage gaps
            - Breaking changes
            - Adherence to CLAUDE.md conventions

            **Communication style:**
            - Prefer brevity: bullet points, direct feedback
            - Verbose explanations are acceptable when necessary for clarity or complex issues
            - Group related issues together
            - Prioritize: Critical > Important > Nice-to-have
            - Skip trivial style issues unless pattern violations
            - If clean: "âœ… No significant issues found"
