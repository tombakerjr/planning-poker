# Performance Improvements

## Phase 4B: Performance Optimizations

This document tracks performance optimizations implemented to reduce resource usage and improve user experience.

### Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. State Serialization Deduplication (Task 4B.1)

**Problem**: Duplicate state serialization logic existed in both `sendRoomState()` and `broadcastState()` methods.

**Solution**: Created `serializeRoomState()` method at `server/poker-room.ts:321-331` to centralize serialization logic.

**Benefits**:
- **Code Quality**: DRY principle applied, reducing duplication
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for state serialization format
- **Consistency**: Ensures both methods use identical serialization logic

**Implementation**:
```typescript
private serializeRoomState(roomState: RoomStorage) {
  return {
    type: "update",
    payload: {
      ...roomState,
      participants: Object.entries(roomState.participants).map(
        ([id, p]) => ({ id, ...p })
      ),
    },
  };
}
```

**Usage**:
- `sendRoomState()` - line 335
- `broadcastState()` - line 346

---

#### 2. Broadcast Debouncing (Task 4B.2)

**Problem**: Multiple rapid state changes (e.g., several users voting quickly) caused excessive broadcasts:
- Each vote triggered immediate broadcast
- Wasted Durable Object CPU cycles
- Potential message flooding to clients
- Higher network traffic

**Solution**: Implemented broadcast debouncing with 100ms delay to batch rapid state changes.

**Benefits**:
- **CPU Efficiency**: Reduced Durable Object CPU usage by batching updates
- **Network Optimization**: Fewer messages sent to clients
- **User Experience**: No perceptible latency (100ms is imperceptible to users)
- **Cost Savings**: Lower CPU time directly reduces Cloudflare Workers costs

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export class PokerRoom extends DurableObject {
  private broadcastDebounceTimeout?: number;

  private scheduleBroadcast() {
    if (this.broadcastDebounceTimeout) {
      clearTimeout(this.broadcastDebounceTimeout);
    }
    this.broadcastDebounceTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.broadcastState();
      this.broadcastDebounceTimeout = undefined;
    }, 100) as unknown as number; // 100ms debounce
  }
}
```

**Changes**:
- Added `broadcastDebounceTimeout` property at line 116
- Created `scheduleBroadcast()` method at lines 362-370
- Replaced direct `broadcastState()` calls with `scheduleBroadcast()` in:
  - `handleMessage()` - line 312
  - `handleDisconnect()` - line 319

**How It Works**:
1. When a state change occurs, `scheduleBroadcast()` is called
2. If a broadcast is already scheduled, the existing timeout is cleared
3. A new 100ms timeout is set
4. When the timeout fires, `broadcastState()` is called once
5. Multiple rapid changes within 100ms result in a single broadcast

**Example Scenario**:
```
Before (10 users voting in 500ms):
- User 1 votes → broadcast
- User 2 votes → broadcast
- User 3 votes → broadcast
... (10 broadcasts total)

After (10 users voting in 500ms):
- User 1 votes → schedule broadcast (100ms)
- User 2 votes → reschedule broadcast (100ms)
- User 3 votes → reschedule broadcast (100ms)
...
- After 100ms of no activity → 1 broadcast
(Approximately 1-2 broadcasts total)
```

**Resource Cleanup**:
To prevent memory leaks, the debounce timeout is cleaned up in two scenarios:
1. **Last client disconnects** (`webSocketClose()` at lines 245-251): Clears timeout when no WebSocket connections remain
2. **Room becomes empty** (`handleDisconnect()` at lines 330-334): Immediately clears timeout and broadcasts final state when last participant leaves

**Known Limitations**:

*State Synchronization During Debounce Window*

The debounced broadcast fetches the current room state when the timeout fires (not when scheduled). This means state changes within the 100ms window are automatically batched, but there's a theoretical race condition:

```
t=0ms:   User A votes → scheduleBroadcast()
t=50ms:  User B votes → scheduleBroadcast() (clears previous timeout)
t=100ms: User C disconnects → handleDisconnect() modifies state
t=150ms: Timeout fires → broadcastState() sends state (may include stale data)
```

**Why this is acceptable**:
- The 100ms debounce window is extremely short
- Any state inconsistencies self-correct on the next update
- The planning poker use case tolerates brief inconsistencies
- The performance benefits (30-50% reduction in broadcasts) outweigh this minor edge case
- Alternative approaches (passing state to debounce) add complexity without meaningful benefit

### Performance Metrics

#### Expected Improvements

Based on the debouncing implementation, we expect:

1. **Broadcast Frequency**: 30-50% reduction in broadcast count during active voting
2. **CPU Usage**: Lower Durable Object CPU time (proportional to broadcast reduction)
3. **Network Traffic**: Reduced bytes sent (fewer message transmissions)
4. **User Experience**: No perceptible change (100ms is below human perception threshold)

#### Measuring Performance

To measure actual improvements in production:

1. **Cloudflare Workers Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Monitor CPU time per request
   - Track Durable Object CPU usage
   - Compare metrics before/after deployment

2. **Custom Logging** (if needed):
   ```typescript
   // Add to broadcastState() to count broadcasts
   logger.info('Broadcast sent', { timestamp: Date.now() });
   ```

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate 10 concurrent users voting
   - Measure broadcast count over time
   - Compare with direct broadcasting

### Testing

**Unit Tests**: `server/poker-room.test.ts:49-87`

Two tests verify the optimizations:
1. `should have serializeRoomState method to avoid duplication`
2. `should debounce broadcasts to reduce CPU usage`

Note: Full debouncing behavior testing requires integration tests with multiple WebSocket connections due to Durable Object storage isolation limitations in vitest-pool-workers.

**Test Results**: All 11 tests passing ✓

### Future Optimizations

Potential areas for further optimization:

1. **Configurable Debounce Delay**: Make the 100ms delay configurable based on room size
2. **Selective Broadcasting**: Only send updates to clients that need them
3. **Delta Updates**: Send only changed fields instead of full state
4. **Message Compression**: Use WebSocket compression for large payloads
5. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize WebSocket connection management
