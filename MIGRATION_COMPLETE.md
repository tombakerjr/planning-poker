# Planning Poker Migration - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary

Successfully migrated the planning poker app to use Cloudflare Durable Objects + WebSocket pattern from the Nuxflare chat app. The app now features real-time collaboration with a simplified, modern architecture.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Architecture Migration
- âœ… Removed unnecessary server API routes (`/api/room/create`)
- âœ… Moved to client-side room creation using random IDs
- âœ… Implemented dedicated `websockets/index.ts` worker following chat app structure
- âœ… Separated Nuxt app and WebSocket worker configurations

### 2. WebSocket Implementation
- âœ… Created Durable Objects-based WebSocket worker at `websockets/index.ts`
- âœ… Implemented protocol-based authentication using base64url encoding
- âœ… Added proper message handling for join/vote/reveal/reset actions
- âœ… Implemented real-time state broadcasting to all connected clients

### 3. Frontend Updates
- âœ… Refactored `usePokerRoom.ts` to use @vueuse/core's `useWebSocket`
- âœ… Updated message format to use flat objects (not `{type, payload}`)
- âœ… Fixed room creation flow to generate random IDs and navigate directly
- âœ… Updated connection status handling and modal logic

### 4. Configuration & Build
- âœ… Updated `wrangler.jsonc` to point to Nuxt's `.output/server/index.mjs`
- âœ… Created separate `websockets/wrangler.jsonc` for the worker
- âœ… Cleaned up `package.json` scripts with separate dev/deploy commands
- âœ… Removed old `/server/` directory and legacy code

### 5. Testing & Verification
- âœ… Verified WebSocket worker runs on `localhost:8787`
- âœ… Tested direct WebSocket connections with Node.js
- âœ… Confirmed multi-user real-time synchronization works
- âœ… Validated join/vote/reveal/reset flow end-to-end
- âœ… Fixed base64url encoding compatibility issues

### 6. Documentation
- âœ… Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide
- âœ… Updated `README.md` with current architecture and features
- âœ… Documented WebSocket protocol and message formats

## ðŸš€ Current State

The application is now fully functional with:

- **Real-time WebSocket connections** between frontend and Durable Objects worker
- **Persistent room state** stored in Durable Objects storage
- **Protocol-based authentication** using base64url encoding
- **Automatic reconnection** handling via @vueuse/core
- **Mobile-responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS
- **Clean separation** between Nuxt app and WebSocket worker

## ðŸ”§ Development Commands

```bash
# Start WebSocket worker
pnpm dev:websockets

# Start Nuxt app (in separate terminal)
pnpm dev

# Deploy worker
pnpm deploy:websockets

# Deploy app
pnpm build && pnpm deploy
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance & Scalability

- **WebSocket worker** handles real-time connections efficiently
- **Durable Objects** provide consistent state storage per room
- **Base64url encoding** ensures WebSocket protocol compatibility
- **@vueuse/core** provides robust connection management
- **Cloudflare Workers** offer global edge deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Optional)

Future enhancements could include:
- Room persistence settings (temporary vs permanent)
- Voting time limits and automatic reveals
- Custom poker card sets
- Room admin controls
- Vote history and analytics
- Integration with project management tools

## âœ¨ Key Technical Achievements

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex server API layer in favor of direct WebSocket communication
2. **Real-time Sync**: Perfect state synchronization across multiple connected clients
3. **Protocol Authentication**: Secure room/user identification via WebSocket subprotocols
4. **Modern Stack**: Leveraging Nuxt 4, Vue 3 Composition API, and Cloudflare Workers
5. **Development Experience**: Hot reload for both frontend and WebSocket worker

The planning poker app is now production-ready and follows modern Cloudflare Workers best practices! ðŸŽ‰
